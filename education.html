            <p>Though i have a bit of formal education, i do not believe that success can be taught in the classroom.
                Being book-smart is different from being street-smart. Most people can read a book and pass examinations
                but only few people can develop, grow and profitably run a commercial application. Think about it, how
                many software developers know how to code because they went to school? Very few. Most people taught
                themselves even after reading it as a course in school.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My opinion is that profits are made on the street and not in the classroom.Because i want to always be a
                profit maker and not just a profit spender, i make myself available to street education by
                learning-through-doing. I try many ways to get a problem solved. I have failed many times and i have
                gained many times. Though i fail in some, i seek perfection in all i do which has kept me focused.On the
                street,I
                learned how to turn ideas/problems into codes, codes into secured &
                user-friendly solutions and solutions, into products that users depend on. </p>
            <br>
            <p>So far, i think my biggest lessons from the street are:
                <ol>
                    <li>How to use few resources to acheive so much through cost optimization & integrated efficiency.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Ability to code and develop any requirement.Though different software products come with
                        different unique challenges but the way out is always at the corner and i am always ready to
                        find it.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Ability to easily learn and pick up newly required skill.</li>
                </ol>
